# Git / GitHub / Open Source Development Workshop


Welcome to the Prisoner's Dilemma README. This page will tell you everything you need to know about the basics of **git**, **github**, and collaborating on **open-source** projects. 

Within this repository (PrisonersDilemmaCSWorkshop), you will find this README along with various other files. These files are for the tournament you will be participating in: Prisoner's Dilemma.

Now, before we get started, let's talk a little bit about what a README file is for. In short, the first thing you want to do whenever looking at a new repository for the first time is to look at the README. (i.e. exactly what you are doing right now!) Common items in a README include instructions on how to get involved in the project, how to get the source code onto your local environment (computer), or what the repository/code base does. This particular README will include info on all three in addition to more general information about Git, GitHub, open source development, and further resources to get you going.

(Note, if you are completely new to Git and GitHub you might want to begin first with a different, slightly more basic GitHub repository/tutorial on my page: AnIntroToGitAndGitHub)

So let's dive right in.

### Before you begin - Create an account

i) If you already have a GitHub account, great! (Go ahead and skip to Step One) If not, let's create one.

ii) In the upper right of this page you should see a login button. Select that.

iii) Select 'Create a new account' on this next page

### Step One - Get the source code onto your computer

i) Fork this repository. Do this by clicking the Fork button in the upper right of this page. What this does is copy the current version of this repository onto your own GitHub page!
	(a) You will then see a pop up that asks...
	...
	(d) Now navigate to your profile page and you should see this forked repository sitting there.

ii) At this stage, all of the code it still in the cloud, but we want to get a copy down onto your personal computer. We will do this by **cloning** your forked version locally.

iii) open the code Eclipse or another IDE/editor of your choice
	(a) At the top of Eclipse select File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
	(b) Now navigate to where you cloned the repository locally. (i.e. select the folder presumably with the name: PrisonersDilemmaCSWorkshop).
	(c) Click enter and now you should have the project listed in your Package Explorer sidebar.

Congratulations for making it this far! You have completed the hardest part. Often times with open source projects, getting the code locally without any bugs in the appropriate software is half the battle.

### Step Two - What this code does

i) info on tournament

ii) info on what to edit/change

### Step Three - How to contribute

i) Create a new class within the package src/tournament 
        - You can see examples of ones I have made

ii) add, commit, push to local branch

iii) make a pull request to this repository

Congratulations! Your first open source development contribution!



### Resources

i) [Link to other tutorial]  

ii) Git resources:  
Git tutorial: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1  
Git cheat sheet: https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet  

iii) GitHub resources:  
Popular projects on GitHub: https://github.com/explore  
GitHub's help page: https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/  

iv) Open source resources:  
Good resource for first-timers: http://www.firsttimersonly.com/  
Udacity tutorial: https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775  

But seriously, open source development is a steep learning curve. It may be tough at first, but jumping head first into a project will get you to where you want to be faster than any series of tutorials will.  

v) Other neat projects/sites:  
You get a ton of cool, free stuff as a student on GitHub. Check it out here: https://education.github.com/pack
